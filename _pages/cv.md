## Projects

### Large-Scale Time-Series Weather Data Analysis & Forecasting
- Analysed large-scale real-world time-series data using Pandas, xarray, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- Built and evaluated regression models (polynomial and neural networks) to forecast long-term trends, achieving **R² values up to 0.88**.

### User Behaviour & Demand Pattern Analysis (Group Project)
- Analysed time-stamped usage data to identify daily demand patterns and peak usage periods for Voi bikes.
- Provided data-driven insights to inform improved resource allocation strategies.

### Musical Genre Classification with Machine Learning
- Built a logistic regression classifier using VGGish embeddings to distinguish between musical genres.
- Used Librosa, Soundfile, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
