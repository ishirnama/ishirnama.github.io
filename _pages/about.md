Hi I'm Ishir, a student at the University of Edinburgh studying Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. I'm currently in my first year taking the [Introduction to Computation](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/23-24/dpt/cxinfr08025.htm) course. I have strong interests in **machine learning, data analysis, and computational physics**. Some of the projects I've worked on this year ranges over the domains of **Audio Machine Learning, Geophysical Data Analysis and User Behavior & Demand Analysis**. I have 4 years of experience with Python.

My work focuses on applying **Mathematical modelling, ML algorithms, and Scientific computing** on complex real-world datasets (particularly in fields like **Machine Learning, Physics, Music, Geography and Data Analysis**). I enjoy working with big datasets of real-world data such as **weather, geographical, experimental and Time-series**.

## Technical Background

I have hands-on experience analysing **large, structured datasets** using Python-based scientific tooling, including:

- **Data analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, xarray  
- **Visualisation:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine learning:** Scikit-learn, regression models, neural networks  
- **Mathematics:** Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics  
- **Software tools:** Git, GitHub, SQL, VS Code  

I am particularly interested in **interpretable models**, robust evaluation, and understanding the mathematical structure behind learning algorithms.

## Selected Work

### Large-Scale Weather Data Analysis & Forecasting  
Analysed real-world time-series climate data and built predictive regression and neural network models to forecast long-term trends, achieving **R² scores up to 0.88**.

### Musical Genre Classification with Machine Learning  
Developed a logistic regression classifier using **VGGish embeddings** to distinguish musical genres.  
Tools used: Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

### Invariant Mass of the Z₀ Boson (IRIS Big Data ATLAS)
Worked with simulated CERN LHC datasets to reconstruct the invariant mass of the Z boson and model the distribution using a relativistic **Breit–Wigner** fit. Results were presented as an academic scientific poster.
