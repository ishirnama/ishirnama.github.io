I am a **first-year undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh**, with strong interests in **machine learning, data analysis, and computational physics**.

My work focuses on applying **statistical modelling, algorithmic thinking, and scientific computing** to complex, real-world datasets — particularly in settings inspired by **physics, engineering, and emerging computational technologies**. I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and practice, combining mathematical reasoning with efficient implementation.

## Technical Background

I have hands-on experience analysing **large, structured datasets** using Python-based scientific tooling, including:

- **Data analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, xarray  
- **Visualisation:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine learning:** Scikit-learn, regression models, neural networks  
- **Mathematics:** Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics  
- **Software tools:** Git, GitHub, SQL, VS Code  

I am particularly interested in **interpretable models**, robust evaluation, and understanding the mathematical structure behind learning algorithms.

## Selected Work

### Large-Scale Weather Data Analysis & Forecasting  
Analysed real-world time-series climate data and built predictive regression and neural network models to forecast long-term trends, achieving **R² scores up to 0.88**.

### Musical Genre Classification with Machine Learning  
Developed a logistic regression classifier using **VGGish embeddings** to distinguish musical genres.  
Tools used: Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
