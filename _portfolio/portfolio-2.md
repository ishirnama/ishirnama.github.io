## Time-Series Weather Forecasting

![Visual of the missing value records in the dataset for January across multiple years](/images/missing_values.png)

This project uses the HadCRUT5 Temparature Anomalies dataset from the Met Office website [click here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/HadCRUT.5.1.0.0/download.html) Within this dataset however, there are many NaN values. The plot above shows the intensity of NaN values recorded across the globe.
